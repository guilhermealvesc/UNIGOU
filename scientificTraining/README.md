# Scientific Training / How to do a research document

## Defining a research gap

- An interesting research topic must use a method to be good enough

### What is a research

- Is a systematic investigation and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions
- Continuous search for better understanding and deepening into a problem
- Research is developed to address a problem: the research gap

### What is a research gap

- Is a topic or area which is missing information, limiting the ability of reviewers to reach a conclusion for a given question
- Overcoming the research gap gives benefits (contributing to real world applications)

## Defining a hypothesis

- A hypothesis is
  - a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limitesd evidence as a starting point for further investigation
  - a proposition made as a basis for reasoning, without any assumption of its truth
  - something that we assume within a topic and we will further investigate it with our research

## Research gap and hypothesis

- The research gap is strongly connected to a hypothesis
- Very likely a first hypothesis will not lead to a defined research gap, because the issue may be already well reported in the literature
- In such cases, we have to refine our hypothesis to achieve an interisting research gap
- Before establishing a research gap, check what has been already done in the field

- The research gap is an iterative process developed together with the hypothesis and followed by literature review
- You can only properly formulate your research gap and hypothesis once you perform a thorough literature review

## Finding a research gap

- There are soms steps you can take to help identify research gaps, since it is impossible to go through all the information and research available nowadays

1. Select a topic or question that motivates you
2. Find keywords related terms to your selected topic
   - Besides synthesizing the topic to its essencital core, this will help you in the next step
   - Use the identified keywords to search literature
3. Look for topics or issues that are missing or not addressed within (or related to) your main topic
4. Read systematic reviews

## Example: hypothesis and research gap

- For instance, let us assume the following hypothesis:
  - "Covd-19 lockdowns had a negative impact on the mental health of people"
- In such case, an example of key words research would be
  - "covid-19"
  - "mental health"
- It is important to remark that this is a hypothesis which can only be scientifically verified by following a research methodology or by finding a collection of publications on the topic. In the second case, it is no longer a research gap, so the hypothesis should be refined
- If you keep researching, you can narrow down to other topics. For example:
  - *The impact of covid-19 on the mental health of young mothers, or low-income families, or children under 15 years old, etc.*
- Once you start researching and readint what has been published, you will also go through the methodologies:
  - How was the research conducted? what was the methodology? And how were the results achieved?

## Defining the research gap

- The definition of the research gap must be fine tuned with the current ongoing research and what your research has the potential to bring as an interesting contribution
- Once you define your research gap, your hypothesis comes immediately as the outlook you will give to address the defined research gap

> Research gap: non documented problem at scientific papers/researches
> Hypothesis: comes to outlook the research gap

- The research gap is usually defined by the leading researchers of a department or research team
- The research gap will likely lean towards the direction where the leading researchers want to have the work of their group published
- Typically, when students apply for topics (MSc.; Ph.D.) it is within the direction of the department's research and research publications
- Anyone is capable of producing interesting research and finding a key research gap to address, once they:
  1. develop thorough research (50+ articles) through research databases of what has been published lately within the topic of interest, based on key words
  2. they find the combination of what both interests them (to performa as a methodology) and what needs further deepening outlook within the research community

## Correct Methodology

- When the research gap is defined, the next step is to apply the aappropriate methodology to tackle the problem on hand
- For instance
  - Statistical analysis
  - Questionnaire forms
  - Simulations
  - Coding
  - etc.
