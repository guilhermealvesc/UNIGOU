# Scientific Training / How to do a research document

## Defining a research gap

- An interesting research topic must use a method to be good enough

### What is a research

- Is a systematic investigation and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions
- Continuous search for better understanding and deepening into a problem
- Research is developed to address a problem: the research gap

### What is a research gap

- Is a topic or area which is missing information, limiting the ability of reviewers to reach a conclusion for a given question
- Overcoming the research gap gives benefits (contributing to real world applications)

## Defining a hypothesis

- A hypothesis is
  - a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limitesd evidence as a starting point for further investigation
  - a proposition made as a basis for reasoning, without any assumption of its truth
  - something that we assume within a topic and we will further investigate it with our research

## Research gap and hypothesis

- The research gap is strongly connected to a hypothesis
- Very likely a first hypothesis will not lead to a defined research gap, because the issue may be already well reported in the literature
- In such cases, we have to refine our hypothesis to achieve an interisting research gap
- Before establishing a research gap, check what has been already done in the field

![hypothesisAndResearchGaps](../images/hypothesisAndResearchGaps.png)

- The research gap is an iterative process developed together with the hypothesis and followed by literature review
- You can only properly formulate your research gap and hypothesis once you perform a thorough literature review

![reviewCycle](../images/reviewCycle.png)

## Finding a research gap

- There are soms steps you can take to help identify research gaps, since it is impossible to go through all the information and research available nowadays

1. Select a topic or question that motivates you
2. Find keywords related terms to your selected topic
   - Besides synthesizing the topic to its essencital core, this will help you in the next step
   - Use the identified keywords to search literature
3. Look for topics or issues that are missing or not addressed within (or related to) your main topic
4. Read systematic reviews

## Example: hypothesis and research gap

- For instance, let us assume the following hypothesis:
  - "Covd-19 lockdowns had a negative impact on the mental health of people"
- In such case, an example of key words research would be
  - "covid-19"
  - "mental health"
- It is important to remark that this is a hypothesis which can only be scientifically verified by following a research methodology or by finding a collection of publications on the topic. In the second case, it is no longer a research gap, so the hypothesis should be refined
- If you keep researching, you can narrow down to other topics. For example:
  - *The impact of covid-19 on the mental health of young mothers, or low-income families, or children under 15 years old, etc.*
- Once you start researching and readint what has been published, you will also go through the methodologies:
  - How was the research conducted? what was the methodology? And how were the results achieved?

## Defining the research gap

- The definition of the research gap must be fine tuned with the current ongoing research and what your research has the potential to bring as an interesting contribution
- Once you define your research gap, your hypothesis comes immediately as the outlook you will give to address the defined research gap

> Research gap: non documented problem at scientific papers/researches
> Hypothesis: comes to outlook the research gap

- The research gap is usually defined by the leading researchers of a department or research team
- The research gap will likely lean towards the direction where the leading researchers want to have the work of their group published
- Typically, when students apply for topics (MSc.; Ph.D.) it is within the direction of the department's research and research publications
- Anyone is capable of producing interesting research and finding a key research gap to address, once they:
  1. develop thorough research (50+ articles) through research databases of what has been published lately within the topic of interest, based on key words
  2. they find the combination of what both interests them (to performa as a methodology) and what needs further deepening outlook within the research community

## Correct Methodology

- When the research gap is defined, the next step is to apply the aappropriate methodology to tackle the problem on hand
- For instance
  - Statistical analysis
  - Questionnaire forms
  - Simulations
  - Coding
  - etc.

## Literature Review (Why Literature Review)

- Get yourself oriented in the field
  - See the topics, the state of the art
  - Get familiar with the terminology and the style of writing

- Build your research on a serious basis
  - You can use findings of previous authors
  - You need to use proved methodology!

- Is it really something new?
  - Maybe it has been done
  - Maybe you are doing it wrong

### The first steps

![firstSteps](../images/firstSteps.png)

- You should already know the topic of your research/interest
- I you do:
  - What are the keywords for its description?
  - Do you know the corret terminology in English?
  - What are the synonyms of your keywords?
  - What are narrower/broader terms?

### Pratical Example

- Analysis of Noise Reduction in Education Buildings
- You want to know the acoustic issues in education buildings, ways of noise propagation, common measures of noise reduction, etc.

| Keywords                      | Synoyms, related terms                    |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Education building acoustics  | Noise in schools, Noise in universities   |
| Building structures           | Acoustic walls, Building acoustics        |
| Noise propagation             | Sound propagation, Noise/Sound spreading  |
| Noise reduction               | Noise control, Mitigation, Abatement      |
| Noise attenuator              | Silencers, Noise dampers                  |
| Sound insulation              | Sound insulation                          |

> Keep adding to your list

### Not sure with the terminology?

### Logical Operators

- It is possible to combine your keywords to make your search more effective
  - AND, OR, NOT
  - Substitute Symbols
  - Parnethesis "" (Tells the search engine to look for the exact sentence, in the exact order)
  - Filters

![parenthesisSearch](../images/parenthesisSearch.png)

- Use Advanced Search Functions
  - (sulphur OR sulfor) ... sul*ur ... sul?ur
  - dissertation site:harvard.edu ... (searches only one site)
  - +nose ... (word ,,noise'' musb be included in the results)

### Advanced Search On Google Scholar (generally applicable tips for all GOOGLE searches)

- (noise OR sound) "education building" -Health (- excludes word)

- AND is added automatically (not necessary to specify)
- OR can be substituted by the symbol |
- NOT cannot be used, use the symbol - (minus)
- Use " " (hyphens) for multiple-word-term search
- Symbom * substitutes the whole word
- You can use the operator (site, allintitle, author, etc.)
- Check Google Manual for more

## Databases of Peer-Review Literature

- Resources of The Modern Knowledge

### Resources Of Knowledge

- In the past
  - Knowloedge shared by written communication between individual scientists(letters)
  - Limited amount of books
  - Somo journals(only 18th century)
- Nowadays
  - Many books
  - Many conference proceedings
  - Uncountable Scientific articles

### The good, the bad and the ugly

- The good
  - Vast amount of relevant up-to-date information available upon few clicks, if done right
- The bad
  - It can be difficult to get oriented
  - It can be overwhelming, time consuming and contra productive
- The ugly
  - Not all the information are good quality!
  - Lot of bad publications(writing only to have a publication, predatory journals without peer-review, etc...)

### In Search of Quality (Renowned journals)

- Assure quality of content
- Each paper goes through a rigorous peer-review by other lead scientists
- Assessment if the research was done well:
  - The background is resoanable
  - The methodology fits
  - The data are correctly processed
  - There are no logical mistakes
  - etc...

### In Search of Quality (Renowned citation databases)

- Assure quality of sources
- Rigorous peer-review of the accepted (referenced) journals
- Very strict criteria, board of experts
- Developed metrics for authors, journals, conferences, books
- They can help you to find most relevant up-to-data publications

### Google Scholar - Be Aware

- Google Scholar collects research papers form all over the web
- Also including grey literature and non-peer reviewed papers and reports

### Quality metrics - Journals

- Quantify the importance of the journal
- Measurement of quality / impact of the journal
  - Journal Impact Factor (Web of Science)
  - CiteScore (Scopus)

### Journal Metrics - Journal Impact Factor (WoS)

- The Impact Factor is a measure of the frequency with which the articles in a journal has been cited in a particular year
- Two years span back - and the Impact Factor is used in the following year
  - IF = Citations(y) / (Publications(y-1) + Publications(y-2))
- For example Impact Factor of Nature for 2017 (reported in 2018)
  - IF(2017) = Citations(2017) / (Publications(2016) + Publications(2015)) = 74090/(880+902) = 41.577

### Journal Metrics - Citescore (Scopus)

- CiteScore is based on the number of citations to documents (articles, reviews, conference papers, book chapters...) by a journal over four years, divided by the number of the same document types indexed in Scoups and published in those same four years.
- Longer period = usually higher than impact factor
  - Cs(y) = (Citations(y) + Citations(y - 1) + Citations(y - 2) + Citations(y - 3))/(Publications(y) + Publications(y - 1) + Publications(y - 2) + Publications(y - 3))
- For example Impact Factor of Nature for 2019 (reported in 2020):
  - Cs(2019) = (Citations(2019) + Citations(2018) + Citations(2017) + Citations(2016))/(Publications(2019) + Publications(2018) + Publications(2017) + Publications(2016)) = 243894 = 51.0

### Predatory Journals

- Avoid under any circumstances
  - Biased journals (publish everything for a payment)
  - Tricking researchers to publish in them
  - Do not use them, do not publish in them
- How to identify them
  - Supicious behaviour
  - Payment for publication
  - Very short terms (no peer-review)
  - Sometives very similar to a renowned journal
  - Check Beall's list

### Renowned Databases

- Vast amount of information that must be filtered
- As mentioned in the previous modules:
  - Search in a clever way
  - Do not read everything
  - Work with Keywords
  - Use logical operators
  - Use advanced search engines
  - etc...

### Overview of the databases

- Databases of citations and abstracts
  - Basic info about the paper (Name, authors, keywords, abstract...)
  - Provides link to full text (web of journal of Publisher...)
  - The search is free, the full text sometimes (open-access papers and journals)
- Databases of Publicationss
  - Full text available
  - The access may be paid (check your university / library)
